          <p>Meles Zenawi Asres (Ge'ez: መለስ ዜናዊ አስረስ mäläs zenawi asräs About this sound listen (help·info); 9 May 1955 – 20 August 2012, born Legesse Zenawi Asres)[2] was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia from 1995 until his death in 2012.[3] From 1989, he was the chairman of the Tigrayan Peoples' Liberation Front (TPLF), and the head of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) since its formation in 1991. Before becoming a prime minister in 1995, he had served the president of the transitional government of Ethiopia from 1991 to 1995.[4]

In 1975, he left college to join the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF), and opposing the Derg. After the overthrow of the military regime, he was elected as a president of the transition Government and then as a Prime Minister.

His government was credited with reforms such as those that led to a multi-party political system in Ethiopia, introduction of private press in Ethiopia and decreased child mortality rates. [5][6] Known by the media as one of Africa's strongmen,[4] he was also an ally in the United States' War on Terror..</p>
